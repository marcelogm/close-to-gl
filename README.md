# Educational OpenGL Alternative Implementation

This project offers an educational resource for studying computer graphics. It includes a self-developed graphic pipeline, covering components such as light calculations, resampling techniques, mipmapping, face culling, perspective division, rastering, texture rendering, and a custom shader system. Users can select between OpenGL and a custom 'close-to-GL' implementation, providing a platform for exploring the technical aspects of computer graphics through a sample implementation.
